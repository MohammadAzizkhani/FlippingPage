    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p style="font:italic 14px arial">
        Still images may be small or large, or even full screen. They may be colored,
        placed at random on the screen, evenly geometric, or oddly shaped. Still
        images may be a single tree on a wintry hillside; stacked boxes of text against
        a gray, tartan, or Italian marble background; an engineering drawing; a
        snapshot of your department manager's new BMW. Whatever their form,
        still images are generated by the computer in two ways: as bitmaps (or
        paint graphics) and as vector-drawn (or just plain "drawn") graphics.
        Bitmaps may also be called "raster" images. Likewise, bitmap editors are
        sometimes called "painting" programs. And vector editors are sometimes
        called "drawing" programs.

        Bitmaps are used for photo-realistic images and for complex drawings
        requiring fine detail. Vector-drawn objects are used for lines, boxes, circles,
        polygons, and other graphic shapes that can be mathematically expressed
        in angles, coordinates, and distances.
