        Carefully planned, well-executed video clips can make a dramatic difference
        in a multimedia project. A clip of John F. Kennedy proclaiming "Ich
        bin ein Berliner" in video and sound is more compelling than a scrolling
        text field containing that same speech. Before deciding whether to add
        video to your project, however, it is essential to have an understanding of
        the medium, its limitations, and its costs. This chapter provides a foundation
        to help you understand how video works, the different formats and
        standards for recording and playing video, and the differences between
        computer and television video.
