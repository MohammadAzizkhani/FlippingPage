    <h1>The Power of Sound</h1>

    <br />
    <p style="font:italic 14px arial">
        When something vibrates in the air by moving back and forth (such as
        the cone of a loudspeaker), it creates waves of pressure. These waves spread
        like the ripples from a pebble tossed into a still pool, and when they reach
        your eardrums, you experience the changes of pressure, or vibrations, as
        sound. In air, the ripples propagate at about 750 miles per hour, or Mach
        1 at sea level. Sound waves vary in sound pressure level (amplitude) and in
        frequency or pitch. Many sound waves mixed together form an audio sea
        of symphonic music, speech, or just plain noise.
